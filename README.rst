Turn 'noise' to signal: accurately rectify millions of erroneous short reads through graph learning on edit distances
=====================================================================================================================

**noise2read**, originated in a computable rule translated from PCR erring mechanism that: a rare read is erroneous if it has a neighboring read of high abundance, turns erroneous reads into their original state without bringing up any non-existing sequences into the short read set(<300bp) including DNA and RNA sequencing (DNA/RNA-seq), small RNA, unique molecular identifiers (UMI) and amplicon sequencing data.
